# Hash-Rainbow
A simple python script that generates a rainbow table for a given key space

This is a na√Øve approach, a more sophisticated algortihm would make use of gpu's this does not. In addition, the script does not yet make use of chaining/ reduction functions, in a sense not making it a rainbow table at all.

Take care using the script as it can very quickly generate very large files,
